This is an example of a Restful WebApi I built for practice.

This project uses a Code first approach using Entity framework.
HTTP Methods used (Get,Post,Put,Delete,Patch,Head,Options)

Other features include:
Data Validation,
Logging,
Paging and Searching,
Sorting and Data shaping,
Hateoas,
Additional Media Types,
Caching
and Rate Limiting.


I Have included a script to reset and fill the database with sample data and also some postman requests.

Additional Notes are listed in Program.CS
